SpawnTimer v0.1 (c) rZr/opicr0n
===============================

Code gathered from various sources
Hacking and improvements by: rZr/opicr0n

-----------
Requirement
-----------

SpawnTimer has been tested to work on Windows 7 64-bit. Please let me know if it works on other distributions. I believe it will not work on Windows 7 32-bit. Could someone let me know?

SpawnTimer uses an overlay to display an timer. Do note that this will not work in fullscreen mode within games. Please use windowed borderless settings in your game.

-----
Usage
-----

alt + xmouse1			start/stop spawn timer
alt + xmouse2			start/stop custom timer

alt + mousewheeldown	add time to spawn timer
alt + mousewheelup		subtract time from spawn timer

alt + double leftclick	toggle position between attack/defend
alt + double rightclick	toggle map between chapel/undergroup/terminal/..

ps: xmouse1 and xmouse2 are the buttons on the side of the mouse

------------
Sounds/Mixer
------------

After starting the program for the first time. Make sure to check your
windows mixer (type "sndvol" in start or commandprompt). Adjust the sound
level to your preferred volume. 

-------------
Configuration
-------------

All sounds, timers and triggers will be configurable in the near future. 
As of yet only the sounds, spawntime and three alerts are configurable. 

Check spawntimer.ini for details.
